# ResponsivePortfolio

Task was to update a previously completed portfolio so that it is more responsive. This includes the overall layout as well as the pictures. Bootstrap framework was added in as well as changes to the old format to make a navbar. This process allowed me to learn about and integrate bootstrap and its rows and columns formatting. 

 Troubles quickly arouse as I was not as versed in rows and columns as I originally thought. I was able to learn on the fly and finally I understood that you should not use a column unless you have row. I also had to overcome some of the preset formatting that is built in to bootstrap when I wanted to make adjustments.

 # Purposes

 Learning bootstrap is a very helpful step on my way to getting better at development. Using premade pieces allows a developer to speed up the process. Bootstrap is also made to be responsive which can be very beneficial.

This will be a showcase of my work as it is completed to prospective employers.


Used bootstrap as well as vs studio pro to complete the code.
Consists of 3 html pages and a css page as well as folders containing pictures used.
